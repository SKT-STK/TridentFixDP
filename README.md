in vannila trident is pretty much useless,
but with this datapack, now you can add sharpness and all other sword enchantments to it!,
as well as buffing channeling to now work in just rain not thunderstorms, and with the 2nd level of it also on the ground, not just mobs,
fixed the most annoying shit ever, aka. when youd throw your trident and it would get picked up into a random ass slot, when now it gets picked up to the same slot it was thrown from, even with full inventory
